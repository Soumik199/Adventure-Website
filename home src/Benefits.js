     <h3>Main Objective of Adventure ?</h3>
     <p>
     Adventure travel pushes you outside of your comfort zone.<br> It puts you in unfamiliar situations and challenges you to test your mettle.<br> 
     In the last millenia, the typical adventure traveler was a young gap year<br> kid bungee jumping off cliff. 
     In those days, adventure travel often meant risky.<br> Not anymore. Todayâ€™s adventure traveller is often over fifty, <br>
     super busy with a high stress job, has more disposable income, and when vacationing, <br>instead of seeking risk,
      instead seeks meaningful and life changing experiences, <br>and finds that adventure travel delivers.
